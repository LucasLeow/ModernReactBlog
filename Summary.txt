== 1 React Intro ==
    - JS library created by FB
    - used by Netflix & Insta
    - used to create JS-driven dynamic web apps
    - other similar frameworks: Angular | Vue
    - create Single Page Apps quickly (single HTML page sent from server)
        - React handles everything else
            - website data
            - user interactivity
            - routing between pages

    - New pages handled by React instead of being sent from Server
    - eg: if user click on button for "/contact"
        - React injects "/contact" form component
        - Loading much faster compared to conventional retrieval page from Server using HTTP request
            
    React basics
        - components | events | templates | props | forms
    React Router
        - routes | route params | redirects
    React Hooks (to handle state)
        - useState | useEffect | custom Hooks


== 2 Getting started with React ==

    1) Create project dir
    2) npx create-react-app lucas-blog
        - using npx, don't have to use create-react-app tool
        - will take some time to download all dependencies required by React (into node_modules)
