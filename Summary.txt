== 1 React Intro ==
    - JS library created by FB
    - used by Netflix & Insta
    - used to create JS-driven dynamic web apps
    - other similar frameworks: Angular | Vue
    - create Single Page Apps quickly (single HTML page sent from server)
        - React handles everything else
            - website data
            - user interactivity
            - routing between pages

    - New pages handled by React instead of being sent from Server
    - eg: if user click on button for "/contact"
        - React injects "/contact" form component
        - Loading much faster compared to conventional retrieval page from Server using HTTP request
            
    React basics
        - components | events | templates | props | forms
    React Router
        - routes | route params | redirects
    React Hooks (to handle state)
        - useState | useEffect | custom Hooks


== 2 Getting started with React ==

    1) Create project dir
    2) npx create-react-app lucas-blog
        - using npx, don't have to use create-react-app tool
        - will take some time to download all dependencies required by React (into node_modules)

            -- Info about React project --
                - node_modules
                    - where all dependencies that comes with React is located
                    - any additional packages will be installed here
                
                - "public" dir: where all public files are located
                    - index.html : the entry point HTML served to browser
                        - all react code injected to this single index.html, the rest handled by React
                    
                - "src" dir: 99% of code will be here
                    - contains React Components
                    - App.js: The default React component created
                    - App.css: css file to style components
                    - App.test: for testing
                    - index.js: To kickstart application
                        - take all React components & mount to DOM
                    - reportWebVitals.js: Performance monitoring, not vital. Can delete if not needed
                        - if deleted, must go to index.js and delete corresponding usage

                - package.json
                    - contains all dependencies
                    - contains scripts to run shortcut for commands
            
    3) Preview react project (go to project dir)
        - npm start
        - npm run build
            * only standard cmds can run npm <cmd>, else must include "run" keyword

== 3 React Components & Templates ==

    - React Components (Building blocks for any React app)
        - A JS function that returns JSX expression (Function name starts with Capital letter)
            - JSX is nothing but HTML tags within return function

        - Each component a section of content on webpage
            - Nav component
            - Article component
            - Sidebar component
            etc.

        Components contain:
            - template (JSX HTML expression)
            - logic (JS functions using template literals)

        - App.js is root Component
        - babel converts JSX to HTML & renders to DOM
        - Older versions of React need to import React from "react" for each component
            - version 17 & above, not needed

                1) remove all content in App.js <div> tags, keeping only <div> tags
                2) Must always export default <Component> & import <Component> from <path> in index.js
