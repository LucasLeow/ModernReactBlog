== 1 React Intro ==
    - JS library created by FB
    - used by Netflix & Insta
    - used to create JS-driven dynamic web apps
    - other similar frameworks: Angular | Vue

    -- What is Redux --
        - A layer on top of React
        - Helps with state management
            - data in app
            - UI state of app
            
    React basics
        - components | events | templates | props | forms
    React Router
        - routes | route params | redirects
    Redux
        - stores | actions | reducers


== 2 How React Works
    - Lifeblood of React is components
    - Create components representing different UI
        - navbar component
        - searchbox component
        - footer component etc.

    - React inject components into DOM
    - Components are in JS representation (virtual DOM)
    - virtual DOM rendered to actual DOM
    - React refers to virtual DOM to see if any changes
        - will only update the necessary changes to actual DOM
        - instead of constant re-rendering entire DOM
    
    - Won't really touch on the virtual DOM, just an explanation of what happens under the hood

    -- React Components --
        - JS functions written in JSX expressions
        - Can contain state (data / UI state)
        - Can contain JS for functionality
